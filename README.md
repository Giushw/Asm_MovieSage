Prototype web presentation page With Vue 3 + Vite

## Intro
Hi this is a quick prototype just to experiment with vue-create (vue 3 + vite) and regain some knowledge of it.
It's pretty simple to use after you spend some minute to read this quick guide.

## Getting started
To start and see the project for making things quick i suggest to:
- From the project folder use **npm install**, to install locally the project.
- Then **npm run dev**, to Compile and Hot-Reload for Development.
- If you fancy some unit tests **npm run test:unit**, Still in WIP.
- If you fancy some e2e tests **npm run test:e2e:dev**, Still in WIP.
- Better if run in production mode (**npm run build** + **npm run test:e2e**), Still in WIP.
- Voil√† le jeu son fe!

#### Enjoy!

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
